        <h3>PC Building</h3>
        <p class="building-skill-description">
          I built my first PC when I was 14, ever since I've had a fascination
          with constructing, modifying and upgrading computers. From researching
          the components within my budget; to getting the cable management
          <i>just</i> right and finally booting the finished build, ever since
          my first successful POST I've been obsessed with all things IT.

        <h3 class="networking-heading">Networking</h3>
        <p class="networking-skill-description">
          During the first semester at of my Masters at Griffith University I
          was introduced to the fundamentals of networking, and was quickly
          engaged with understanding how enterprises connect their users,
          exchange data and run business processes. I've since begun studying
          towards my CompTIA Network+ Certification, with the goal of developing
          a deeper grasp of physical and virtual networks, the protocols that
          underpin them and the modern transition towards the Cloud.

        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        <p class="viz-skill-description">
          After being first being exposed to beautiful BI dashboards during my
          Undergraduate majoring in Marketing, I wanted to learn for myself the
          techniques of analysing data. First I started with understanding
          relational database design; then mastered complex SQL queries to
          gather data; R and Python tools like Pandas to manipulate and analyse
          complex datasets; while dabbling into Machine Learning to create
          predictions; until I finally made my way to building dashboards with
          software like Tableau and PowerBI. I find the Data Analytics space
          fascinating from top to bottom.
